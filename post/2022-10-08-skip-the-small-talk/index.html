<p>Imagine a party. At the beginning, the host tells the attendees there are only two rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can&rsquo;t talk about work</li>
<li>You can&rsquo;t talk about cities</li>
</ul>
<p>Standard conversational crutches will not work tonight. Yet, projected in a prominent place, is a list of questions. Conveniently, these are the sorts of questions you&rsquo;d ask someone at a specific kind of gathering. They&rsquo;re a little quirky, slightly strange. Each wants to land at the intersection of probing and whimsical.</p>
<p>Such a list might look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>What&rsquo;s the worst advice you&rsquo;ve ever received?</li>
<li>What simple thing still blows your mind?</li>
<li>Which of your personality traits has been the most useful?</li>
<li>Imagine you have a closet full of robots at the ready. Which of your various obligations would you assign to a robot? Which tasks and activities would you keep to yourself, because you enjoy them too much to delegate them to even a robot who is better than you?</li>
<li>Would you plug yourself into Nozick&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_machine">experience</a> machine?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s the last thing that made you laugh hard?</li>
<li>What keeps you up at night?</li>
<li>‘The first thing we do, let&rsquo;s kill all the lawyers’ (William Shakespeare). Discuss.</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;re doing now that you probably shouldn&rsquo;t be?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s a mainstream belief you&rsquo;re totally in agreement with? (Tyler Cowen)</li>
<li>Why is the idea of apocalypse appealing?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s a mainstream belief you disagree with vehemently? (Peter Thiel)</li>
<li>If you had to write a book, what would you write it on?</li>
<li>What do you understand that 99% of people don&rsquo;t?</li>
<li>What do you not understand that 99% of people do?</li>
<li>What is one thing everyone should experience?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s a formative experience you&rsquo;ve had over the last 2 years?</li>
<li>What’s the most useful concept you have that doesn’t have a name?</li>
<li>What is one unwritten rule you learned the hard way?</li>
<li>If you had a clock that would countdown to any one event of your choosing, what event would you want it to count down?</li>
<li>What browser tabs do you have open right now? (Tyler Cowen)</li>
<li>What are three of the most significant numbers in your life? (Can&rsquo;t do anything birthday related)</li>
<li>Which question can you ask to find out the most about a person?</li>
<li>Why is communication so difficult?</li>
<li>What are you addicted to?</li>
<li>What’s the most outrageous advice you can come up with? OR what advice are you scared of giving me because you think I’ll blame you if it fails?</li>
<li>Should the beautiful be taxed? Should the ugly be compensated?</li>
<li>How do you want to raise your kids?</li>
<li>Invent a new idiom</li>
<li>Is the future of the humanities teaching Great Books to engineers?</li>
<li>‘The caterpillar who knew himself would never become a butterfly’ (Andre Gide) Discuss.</li>
<li>What history would you teach your children?</li>
<li>Improve the rules of any one sport.</li>
<li>When we make contact with an extra-terrestrial civilization, what should we tell them is humanity’s greatest achievement?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s your favorite story? Real or fictional.</li>
<li>The University of Chicago abolished its football team and heavily deemphasized sports in the 1930s. Was this a good idea?</li>
<li>In which area of life do you have the best taste? (Follow-up: why aren&rsquo;t you spending more time in that area?)</li>
</ul>
<p>This list takes questions and inspiration from many sources. Chief among them are <a href="https://lamaalrajih.wordpress.com/2019/07/24/skip-the-small-talk-part-one/">Lama&rsquo;s</a> list, and <a href="https://verbivoco.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/all-souls-general-exam-questions-2009-to-2014.pdf">All Souls</a> examination papers. I plan on updating the list often and linking to sources as I remember them.</p>
